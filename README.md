# CS_3120_Project

A user-recognition project powered by keyboard input data. This program uses features discerned from data collected by volunteers. Our processes will explore several elementary techniques of machine learning.
                

## Instructions
1. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/GalacticWafer/CS_3120_Project.git`
2. Use your preferred method of running python files to run typingtest.py
3. When the gui appears, start typing the prompt in the lower half of the window.
4. There are two prompts to type. One is for model training, the other is for testing.
5. After you complete both test, send your `logs.csv` to us. You can use Teams if you're connected to us through MSU Denver, or send to one of the email addresses below.

## Required Python Modules
All are pre-installed with the standard Python3 library.
- tkinter
- re
- os
- time
- datetime


## Maintainers
- Malcolm Johnson https://galacticwafer.github.io
- Adam Wojdyla https://github.com/awojdyla89


## Secure Programming
- This program only records keystrokes from the typing test. 
- No other windows are allowed to log keystrokes
- No data sets will be available on this repo
- The program can be conveniently turned off at any time by closing the typing test

We would really appreciate your support.
