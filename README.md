# CS_3120_Project

A user-recognition project powered by keyboard input data. This program uses features discerned from data collected by volunteers. Our processes will explore several elementary techniques of machine learning.
                
## Requirements 

### Python 3.4 or higher

### Python Modules
- tkinter
- re
- time
- datetime


## Instructions
1. Clone the repo: `https://github.com/GalacticWafer/CS_3120_Project.git`
2. Use your preferred method of running python files to run typingtest.py
  + Note: If you are on a Linux distribution or running a non-standart Python installation, you may need to run `pip install tkinter`
4. When the gui appears, start typing the prompt in the lower half of the window, just like a typing test.
5. There are two prompts to type. One is for model training, the other is for testing. Errors are highlighted red.
6. After you complete both tests, send your `train.csv` and `test.csv` to us. You can use Teams if you're connected to us through MSU Denver, or send to one of the email addresses below.

### Maintainers
- Malcolm Johnson mjohn314@msudenver.edu
- Adam Wojdyla awojdyl2@msudenver.edu

All modules needed are pre-installed unless you're on linux. In that case, use your package manager to install `python3-tk`. ex: with Ubuntu: `sudo apt-get install python3-tk`
             
## Secure Programming
- This program only records keystrokes from the typing test. 
- No other windows are allowed to log keystrokes
- No data sets will be available on this repo
- The program can be conveniently turned off at any time by closing the typing test

We would really appreciate your support.
