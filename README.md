# CS_3120_Project

A user-recognition project powered by keyboard input data. This program uses features discerned from data collected by volunteers. Our processes will explore several elementary techniques of machine learning.
                
## Want to become a volunteer?

We would really appreciate it! [See the official documentation here](https://github.com/GalacticWafer/CS_3120_Project/blob/main/getting_started/GETTING_STARTED.md)

## User Data and Privacy

### It's a big deal

<p>
We take the safety of all volunteers very seriously. Several precautions are taken to maintain this privacy.

- We can only collect data from keystrokes sent to the typing test. No other windows are allowed to 
  log keystrokes
- No data sets will be available on this repo
- The keylogger can be conveniently turned off at any time by closing the typing test


This repository merely acts as a storage for code that can be used to demonstrate how to identify users based on the way that they type. 
</p>


### Required Python Modules

<p>
- tkinter
- re
- os
- time
- datetime
</p>

### Data Collection

<p>
We use a typing test with a given prompt to record keystrokes and the time they occurred in the form of csv files. Here is a list of all the types of data we collect:

- When a key was held down
- When a key was released

All time accuracies are expressed in milliseconds.

We have included the source code for our gui [here](/texteditor.py)
