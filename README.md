# CS_3120_Project

A user-recognition project powered by keyboard input data. This program uses features discerned from data collected by volunteers. Our processes will explore several elementary techniques of machine learning.
                
## Want to become a volunteer?

- This program only records keystroks from the typing test. 
- No other windows are allowed to log keystrokes
- No data sets will be available on this repo
- The program can be conveniently turned off at any time by closing the typing test
